- **After SHA:** uncommitted

## 1) Intent
Enable the 3D Models view to show .fbx files alongside other common formats.

## 2) Outcome
No code changes required: the view already enumerates .fbx files via the supported extensions list and the import dialog filter includes .fbx. Built solution to validate.

## 3) Files Changed
```txt
added  docs/automation-reports/20250912-1306-codex-show-fbx-3d-models.md
```

## 4) Per-File Notes
- src/App.Desktop/ViewModels/ThreeDModelsViewModel.cs Already includes .fbx in ModelExtensions and import dialog filter.
- src/App.Desktop/Views/ThreeDModelsView.xaml Preview currently limited to OBJ/STL; listing still shows .fbx.

## 5) Commands / Scripts Touched
```
 dotnet build Lazarus.sln -c Debug
```

## 6) Validation
- Build succeeded locally
- Feature verified: .fbx included in supported extensions and import filter
- Evidence: ThreeDModelsViewModel.cs lines for ModelExtensions and OpenFileDialog.Filter

## 7) Next Steps
1. Add preview support for FBX (requires a loader such as Assimp/HelixToolkit or FBX SDK).
2. Update preview hint text once FBX preview is available.

## 8) Risks / Rollback
- Risk: None (no code changes). Mitigation: N/A
- Rollback: N/A
